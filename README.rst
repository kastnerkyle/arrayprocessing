arrayprocessing
===============

Array processing algorithms and simulation for RF array design, 
direction of arrival (DOA, also known as direction finding, DF) estimation, and geolocation.

Current Element Types
---------------------

* Monopole

Current Geometry Types
----------------------

* Linear

* Random 

* Circular

* Planar

Current Array Types
-------------------

* Uniformly Weighted

* Classical Beamformer

* MVDR Beamformer

* Null Steered

* Combination Beamformer (combinations of above types i.e. MVDR + null steered)

To Do
=====
* Setup python package

* Read arrays and geometries from CSV

* Add data simulation and dataset support

* Implement DF algorithms 

* Tools for DF error

* Integrate with empy and work towards EM/RF simualtion
